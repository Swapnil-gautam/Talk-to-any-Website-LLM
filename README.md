# Talk-to-any-Website-LLM

This project uses the open-source crawl4AI web crawler (inspired by Ottomator Agents) to extract and convert website data into markdown. The markdown data is then stored in a RAG database powered by Supabase for efficient retrieval. The system leverages OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as the LLM and features a Streamlit-based chat interface for querying the data.

For this implementation, I specifically crawled the Red Hen Lab website, an open-source research community, to demonstrate its effectiveness.
